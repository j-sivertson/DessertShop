## Overall project idea

This project is to imitate what a cash register would do in a store. You can add specific items that you want to purchase and then a a receipt will be created for you. The entire user interface was built onto the console. There is a admin section where additional features are given to the admin.

## How to get the project running

The main method is stored within DessertShop. Run that file and the application will run for you.
